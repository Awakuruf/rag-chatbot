# Laozi

- Introducing the ***Primitivists***
    - A social movement and philosophical position
        - Emerged from somewhere early - mid Warring state period
    - Seems to be at least one major feature of (or influence on) the *Daodejing*
- What do you think about the writing style, content and tone?

## The Crisis of Legitimacy

- Loss of Zhou King’s authority
- Decline of the Zhou
    - Leads to the Warring States
- Each of our first three thinkers responds to this crisis
- They also ask some fundamental questions about human society
- The rise of “civilizations” / complex societies
    - Was this system of human organization good? (Was civilization a good thing and if it was how do we solve this crisis?)

## Kongzi

- The innovations of civilization are potentially good
- The problem began with the decline of the Zhou
- Tools of education, moral self-cultivation, cultural refinement
- Without these things, civilization becomes oppressive and unstable
    - He is critical about the society imbalance - civilization can easily become corrupt (highlights the danger of it)
- The innovation of human civilizations are basically good
- Need consistent norms and standards
- Government authority and regulations are a good thing, but..
    - The “high culture” of the Confucians/elites is wasteful and excessive.
    - Self-interest of elites is oppressive and self-defeating

### Thomas Hobbes: Life in a state of nature is bad

> “… And the life of man, solitary, poore, nasty, brutish and short”
> 

### Life in a “state of nature”

- Violent and chaotic
    - Or free, authentic and peaceful?

## The Primitivists

- Found in the *Zhuangzi* text
- Late addition, not written by *Zhuangzi* himself
- But this may represent Primitivists views that orignated from before this text was written
- “Primitivism” is a term coined by modern scholars to describe this movement.

### Horses’ Hoofs

- Uses interesting metaphor of horses to make a point
- Contrasts horses living in nature vs horses living in human civilizations & interventions
    - Horses living in wild = happy & running around together
    - Horses living in human civilizations = they are like machines, not living freely, being used as a tool of humans and unhappy

> But if you pile poles and yokes on them and line them up in crossbars and shafts, then they will learn to snap the crossbars, break the yoke, rip the carriage top, champ the bit, and chew the reins. Thus horses learn how to commit the worst kinds of mischief. This is the crime of Bo [Le].”
> 
- Horses responding to unprecedent oppressive things done to them

### The Crime of the Sage

> “Then along comes the sage, huffing and puffing after benevolence (*ren*), reaching on tiptoe for righteousness (*yi*), and the world for the first time has doubts” - “Horses’ Hoofs”
> 
- We tend to view Kongzi and historical sages who founded civilizations as great heroes, but actually these things become tools of oppressions and turns us against our actual nature.
- Direct attack on the Confucians and Mohists who talks about:
    - Reducing crime
    - Stopping war
    - Reforming people ethically
    - Changing their behaviour
- But who are the ***real*** criminals?
    - Those who break the state’s rules? (Horses)
    - Or those who ***created*** those rules? (The horse trainer / owners)
- Uncarved simplicity (*supu*): Idea of things in natural states - horses living happily in the field vs being restricted and oppressed into unnatural way of living.

### Untouched Jade

- Inverse of what Kongzi was talking about the carving of hunk of crude imperfect jade and turning it into something beautiful and refined.
    - Leave things as they are and not turn them into something else → Laozi & Primitivists view
- The problem *began* with “civilization,” cultural refinement and government authority → Laozi & Primitivists view
- The solution?
    - The *Daodejing* offers a unique perspective:
        - Trying to solve the problem is the source of the problem itself
        - Therefore, we need a “non-solution”
            - They think people living in agricultural system is okay, just stop trying to advance civilization to solve the root problem that starts from civilization (ironic)

## Designing a “Non-Solution”

- The *Daodejing* avoids clear, logical arguments or statements
- The text presents counterintuitive perspectives
- Reading the text should have effect of removing your assumptions

> “Everyone in the world knows that when the beautiful strives to be beautiful, it is repulsive. Everyone knows that when the good strives to be good, it is no good. And so, To have and to lack generate each other. Difficult and easy give form to each other. Long and short off-set each other. High and low incline into each other. Note and rhythm harmonize with each other. Before and after follow each other. - *Daodejing 2*
> 

### The Scholar Recluses

> “The whole world is engulfed in a great flood, and who can change it? Given this, instead of following a scholar who merely avoids the bad people [of this age], wouldn’t it better for you to follow shcolars like us who avoid the age itself?
> 
- Great flood = chaos in the Warring Period
- The world is too fundamentally broken and the crisis is too severe.
    - You can try to be good in this world and influence others
    - Or you can just remove yourself from the situation all together
- Social movement of educated elites
    - Probably develops after Kongzi’s death
- **Withdrawing from the society** - is THE movement
- Living a simple, communal life of agriculture

## Conclusions

- Laozi is the third and final of our “early” thinkers
    - What Laozi does in *Daodejing* is philosophically different from the rest of Primtiives
        - The philosophical response is very nuanced which is not seen in other Primitives writings
    - Each of these three thinkers responds directly to the crisis of legitimacy
- The “Primitivists” suggests a more fundamental source to the problem.
- The scholar recluses seem to view the problem as unsolvable at the individual level.
- As we will see, the *Daodejing* offers an alternative perspective and solution to the crisis
- Ultimately, all attempts to “solve the problem simply add new problems
- The solution must be a “non-solution.

## Laozi: The Person

- **Laozi - The Old Master:** Supposedly author of the Daodejing.
    - Very mysterious / mythical figure - a lot of contemporary historians don’t believe that such figure existed
- Supposedly:
    - A contemporary (and elder) of Kongzi
    - An educated and wise figure (sage filled with pithy wisdom)
    - Sometimes magical… (makes it hard to believe in historical figures)
        - One suggests that when he was born, he was already in his 80s and he bursts out of extra ordinary places (forehead and armpit of his mother).
        - Yoda like figure - magical hermit and provides wisdoms
- Ventures west to live the life of a hermit
    - Problems of China in Eastern Zhou period is so bad that he just leaves and goes West outside of civilized China
- At the Western Gate, stopped by guard
    - The guard is horrified by the thought that this great source of wisdom is going to leave China and not leave any of his ideas behind
- Leaves his thoughts behind in the ***Daodejing***
    - Before he leaves Eastern China, in one fluid period of writing, he writes out his text (Daodejing)

> Those who know do not talk about it; Those who talk about it do not know. - *Daodejing* 56
> 
- There’s a good chance about Laozi and the guard at the gate supports resolve this contradiction tension - Laozi knew he chose not to speak, but then when he was pressed to write his idea down then he produced *Daodejing*

## ***Daodejing - The Classic of the Way and its Power/Virtue***

- Developing a reading strategy…
    - Doesn’t lay out logical arguments and support them with evidence and explanations…
- One approach: think about ***“aphorisms”***

### Aphorisms

- “A pithy observation that contains a general truth”
    - Similar to proverb
    - Very short and memorable expression that contains some kind of general truth that you can apply to all sorts of different situations.
- It’s trying to point towards more general truths - not to be taken **literally**
- Counterintuitive truths and actions
    - One of the reasons that aphorisms sticks in your mind - 1. they’re very memorable because they don’t sound like they should be true.
        - They’re trying to get you to think about things in a different way than your mind usually immediately does think about things.
- Countering our assumptions
    - Aphorisms are trying to get you to rethink your assumptions and realize that there maybe either always not true or perhaps even usually wrong

### Aphorisms Example

> Slow and steady wins the race
> 
- It’s not literally saying “the slower you go, the more likely you are to win a race.”
    - it’s very counter-intuitive - we all assume to do something very quickly is the way to win something.
- This aphorism is trying to point out that *in many cases,* **if you actually slow down and do things correctly, you’re more likely to succeed and probably succeed more quickly than you would’ve than if you try to rush through it.**

> No news is good news
> 
- Again that’s *literally* not true, there is such thing as a good news.
- Here it’s trying to point at a fact that - if you’re very eagerly waiting to hear something or you’re stressed or worried about a situation and you haven’t gotten any new information, this is meant to kind of counter that stress that is caused by a lack of information.
    - It is there to suggest that *in many cases*, **if you haven’t heard anything, that probably means things are fine.**

> When it rains, it pours
> 
- Again that’s *literally* not true, there are times that it rains and isn’t pouring.
- It’s trying to point towards a shared experience that perhaps all of us have had where ***you may go for a very long time without something happening (good or bad), but all the sudden it happens way more than you can handle.***

They are all trying to point out to the general truth we experience and trying to highlight facts so that we don’t always think about and trying to counter some general assumptions we might have about the world.

### Reading the *Daodejing*

- The text is *deliberately counterintuitive*
    - It’s trying to say things that don’t sound true because it’s trying to highlight some general truths that isn’t immediately obvious.
- Its metaphors point towards larger ideas and general truth.
    - Should not be taken too literally
    - To some extent you have to figure out yourself how to apply it

## Laozi’s Philosophy

## The Way - *Dao (道)*

- ***Dao (道):*** The path, the Way, the way of doing things
    - Founding text of *Daoism.*
- For Kongzi:
    - The correct Way of human culture and ethics
    - The Way of the Western Zhou and of Heaven - *Tian (天)*
        - They believe that *Tian* is interested in human affairs - that Tien is actually concerned about human ideas and human practices
- For early “*Daoists,” Dao* takes on a new meaning:
    - A mysterious force and pattern to the cosmos
        - Similar to how Tian seemed to have been the main god or divine entity (Except *Tian* was more of a human like entity - interested in human conduct)
        - Whereas Laozi, *Dao* seems to be much more impersonal - it’s not really thinking about humans
    - Responsible for the actions and conduct of nature.
- *Dao* is something very vague, something very mysterious, but ultimately it’s the force underlying the consistent patterns of the universe.
    - Something as simple as changing of the seasons (Winter → Spring → Summer → Autumn → Winter)
        - Kongzi: Seen as the actions of god over looking the world
        - Laozi: Simply the natural pattern of the universe and a part of this way that can’t really be located or measured or easily defined.
            - It would apply to the shift from day until night - in any other kind of basic principles that you can detect in the natural world.

## Laozi and the Way

- We have ***lost*** our connection to the Way
    - People of antiquity before we got distracted and went in the wrong direction because we tried to learn and improve our way of life with technology and philosophy.
    - We still had that connection, but at the time of the *Daodejing* is composition during this crisis of legitimacy and the wars and chaos that came as a result - that connection to the way has been lost

> Poised, like one who must ford a stream in winter. Cautious, like the one who fears his neighbours on every side. Reserved, like a visitor… Honest, like unhewn wood (*pu)*. Broad, like a valley. Turbid, like muddy water. - *Daodejing 15*
> 
- *Daodejing* is deliberately counter-intuitive - this quote doesn't sound positive, but it’s trying to make the appeal to our sense of a natural, honest, authentic life.
    - So the ancient people they had the way, they kind of live like a wild animals and he argues that we have lost the way.
- The result?
1. **Inauthenticity:** Each of these new virtues is taking us one step further away from our authentic selves, who are connected to the way (to the *Dao*).
- Ritual propriety is the utmost of inauthentic practices.
    - Ideas here is that each of these new virtues represents an attempt to solve a problem, but that attempt to solve it bring you even further away from where you want to be.

> “When the Way was lost there was Virtue (*de*); When Virtue was lost there was benevolence (*ren*); When benevolence was lost there was righteousness (*yi*); When righteousness was lost, there were the rites (*li*).
> 
- Ritual propriety also looked at things from less charitable perspective which can certainly appear very ***inauthentic.***
    - E.g.: Stepping on someone’s toe - if you are out in a public market and you step on a toe of someone you don’t know and you don’t care about and we’ll never meet again for as long as you live; that’s when ritual propriety comes in and you make such a great scene about it. One would go “Oh I’m so sorry my good friend, please accept my apology.” But if you are at home, spending time with those you care about deeply, and you step on their foot you don’t need to make such a great ordeal to bow, scrape and pull out all of your abilities of ritual propriety because they would just understand.
    - E.g.: Holding a door open for someone - On one hand, it’s nice to hold the door open for someone, but again if I’m with a close family member, I might hold the door open for them just so that they can easily get through (or if their hands are full). It’s simply a natural action that doesn’t necessarily have a lot of thoughts applied to it.  The more thoughts and ritual propriety you put into it, the more inauthentic it would seem…
- Existence of moral virtues indicates a **problem:** The moment you feel the need for moral virtues or ethics, that should provide you with the que for some deeper reflection.
- Identify the real problem and try to solve that through the deeper connection to the Way *(Dao*) and not by inventing new theories, new concepts and new ideas.
1. **War:** Problem of ongoing war also seems to be a consequence of the loss of this way.

> When the world has the Way, fleet-footed horses are used to haul dung. When the world is without the way, war horses are raised in the suburbs. - *Daodejing 46*
> 
- The moment you lose the Way, you’re using things in the world around you for very negative bad purpose. When you have the way, you’re just doing simple, basic agricultural things.
1. **Greed & Inequality:** When the Way have been lost and people are living in this very inauthentic and unequal life, you end up with a small group of people owning more than they could possibly need or use.
- And then the rest of the state or the world is where it’s filled with people who are starving and desperate.

> The court is resplendent; Yet the fields are overgrown. The granaries are empty; Yet some wear elegant clothes… - *Daodejing 53*
> 

### Desire and Greed

- The existence of precious goods ***creates* *desire***
    - People are overwhelmed with  desire, they want things only because those things are produced and put right in front of them.
        - If you’d never encountered these precious goods, you’d never have wanted them.
- Social hierarchy ***creates* *resentment***
    - E.g.: You live in a society where everyone is roughly equal (not a huge gap in people’s wealth), then people aren’t going to feel resentment about their neighbor's wealth if they’re living in approximately the same size and quality of home.
        - And the desire for a larger and more impressive wealth probably isn’t going to be something occupying a lot of your mental energy.
        - Imagine instead a society. where many people are struggling to have a home and then they go out and they walk around the society seeing houses like Rogers. It would seem like certain minority of the population has so much more and you have so little.
    - *Daodejing* seems to be arguing that the very existence of this contrast is what creates resentment and desire within people.

### The Way

- We have lost the Way
    - Lost it by getting too interested in finding new ideas, creating new impressive precious objects, and simply pursuing greed and inauthenticity.
- So what do we do to ***regain*** it?
    - Central solution offered by *Daodejing* to the crisis that is losing the Way is the **concept of non-action (effortless action): *wuwei.***

    # The *Daodejing*

- How to read and make use of the *Daodejing* text?
- Aphorisms: Pointing towards counterintuitive truths
- Not offering a clear or fixed ideological view?
- But there are consistent themes

## The Way

- We have lost the Way
- So what do we do to reconnect with it?
- This is not simple!
    - The way acts in counterintuitive ways
    - Language and logic cannot fully or accurately describe it

## The Law of Reversion

- Excess leads to its opposite
- There is strength in “weakness”
- We should embrace the “feminine”
    - General societal value of “masculine” attributes (war, courage, fighting, etc..) vs more “feminine” traits

> “Turning back (*fan*) is how the Way moves. Weakness is how the Way operates. - *Daodejing 40*”
> 

> “To hold the vessel upright in order to fill it is not as good as to stop in time. IF you make your blade too keen it will not hold its edge. When gold and jade fill the hall none can hold to them…. To withdraw when the work is done is the Way of Heaven - *Daodejing* 9
> 
- There is always limit and you need to acknowledge that point to just stop rather than to keep going and seek more
- The *Taiji* (”Great Ultimate”) symbol: You have two opposite, but complementary forces, (*Yin*-black portion-feminine, passive, receptive energy, *Yang*-white portion- masculine, forceful energy).
    - Anything you define anything in the world, if you define one thing as dark, you are automatically creating the complementary opposite— light.
- There is an instinctive tendency to ***seek more of what we want***
    - We get full of desires of what we want and our immediate instinct is want more and more of it
- We assume that more is ***always better***
    - Although Laozi believes that this is an innate human trait, he also thinks that the society’s emphasize made this worse.
- The Law of Reversion suggests that these strategies will not succeed.
    - Once you go more than what you need, you are just going to be less happy, moral, etc…
- Applies to mostly everything… Including…
    - Political authority: If ruler seeks more power, the more control he will have, but *Daodejing* argues that’s simply not true. To continually seek more power and more authority will have the opposite result
    - Wealth and Power: The more you seek for more wealth, the more you get the opposite
    - The senses and our desire: We enjoy various form of pleasure (sense of taste & food), we want more of it, but there is a limit to those pleasure and if you exceed it, it will eventually make you less satisfied

## Precious Goods and the Senses

- Kongzi’s views on the senses and the emotions
    - These are good things… if culturally refined!
    - Any approach to social problems must take into account human moral psychology
- Mozi’s views on precious goods
    - These are bad things — wasteful and unnecessary
    - Very little interest in the details of human psychology
- Laozi engages with these larger discussions on senses and material wealth
- But he suggests a substantial change in perspective
- This shift in perspective is one of his key innovations
- Laozi’s view on the senses, emotions and precious goods
    - There seems to be something fundamentally unique and dangerous about human psychology
    - We desire precious goods, but are not satisfied by them
        - Precious goods in classical Chinese literally means good difficult to get or difficult to acquire. We only desire them because they were made ***special*** by how difficult they are to obtain. (Fancy clothes, lifestyle, etc… we want those things because we portrayed them as desirable, not because they bring us utility and pleasure)
    - We analyze the world and attempt to solve and improve our conditions

> “The Five Colors blind our eyes.
The five notes deafen our ears.
The five flavours deaden our palates.
The chase and the hunt madden our hearts.
Precious goods impeded our activities.
This is why the sage is for the belly and not for the eye;
And so they cast off the one and take up the other.
- *Daodejing 12*
> 
- The danger of desire
    - The senses
    - “Precious goods”
    - The “belly” vs. the “eye”
        - Fundamental needs “belly” is pretty easy to satisfy
        - The desire of our “eyes” will always look for next thing and it will never be satisfied
    - Laozi would be interested in advertisements… Their design is specifically to give us desires otherwise that we might not have had.
        - E.g.: Odour Spray - over the couple of decades, there uses to be a spray that would give it a nice scent. The problem with these products from the capitalistic perspective, our senses get used to the scent too fast. They designed a plugin scent producer that will produce one smell and once people go nose blind to it, it will cast a new scent that people can smell. (Has motion sensors and they will always produce more)

### The Hedonic Treadmill

- There are certain desires that ***literally cannot be satisfied***
    - The desire is for “more” or what is “precious”
        - The moment you get one of those things, you immediately want the next thing - just like a *treadmill*
- Real satisfaction requires very little (”the belly”)
- Excessive desire creates social turmoil
    - Only small amount of people gets access to those limited things & small number of people that have them are never satisfied with them.
- Human beings always seeks for more with the nature of ***Law of Reversion*** and the innate human ability.

> “The ***greatest*** misfortune is not to know contentment.
The ***worst*** calamity is the desire to acquire.
And so those who know the contentment of contentment are always content.
- *Daodejing* 46”
> 

> “Not paying honour to the worthy leads the people to avoid contention.
Not showing reverence for precious goods leads them to not steal.
Not making a display of what is desirable leads their heart away from chaos.
This is why sage brings things to order by opening people’s hearts and filling their bellies. 
- *Daodejing*
> 

### A Journey of a Thousand Leagues

- A common theme in the text:
    - Problem of our society come from the psychology and the ***mistaken idea of how to find contentment and satisfaction.***
        - The ***Law of Reversion*** states that the more you try and be active about what you want, the opposite is what’s bound to occur
    - We need to solve the problems at it’s ***root.***

> “What is at peace is easy to secure.
What has yet to begin is easy to plan for…
What things before they come to be…

A tree whose girth fills one’s embrace sprang from a downy sprout…
**A journey of a thousand leagues began with a single step.**
- *Daodejing 64*
> 
- You don’t need to compound these problems and rather you want to solve them at root before it becomes overwhelming for it to be addressed.
    - Dealing with problems before they grow out of control
- The concept of nonaction (*wuwei*) is complex
    - Laozi’s solution is very complicated and nuanced which takes a bit of time to wrap your head around.
    - **The only solution has to be *nonaction - it doesn’t mean not to do anything. But rather do things in a very particular way - in an EFFORTLESS ACTION…* To accomplish things without *deliberate effort*.**
- Addressing the source of the problem rather than dealing with the symptoms.
- Preventing problems from arising in the first place.

### Solving Prolbmes at their Root: Crime

- Kongzi: Cultivating Suasive authority
- Mozi: Stable society with strict laws and rules.
- What might Laozi consider a harmful “intervention” when addressing crime?
- Harsher laws and punishments
- Increased law enforcements in neighborhoods
- More prisons
- Laozi would say - you have fundamentally missed the premise. We need to find a way to ***reduce criminals*** the ***deeper issue*** that created this problem in the first place.
    - Are there deeper issues to address that create this “problem” in the first place?
- Do the interventions contribute to harm, or do they address the problem?

# Non-Action - *wuwei*

- It does ***NOT*** literally “do nothing”
    - Describing very particular kind of action - it’s a way of doing things in a non-doing way…??
        - Slingerland translates this to “***effortless action***”
- To accomplish things without ***deliberate effort***.
    - You’re trying to find a way to approach things that still gets them done, but without you consciously deliberately thinking about it or trying to accomplish your goal.
- An approach to the world that is:
    - Unselfconscious
        - You’re not always thinking about your motive or goal
    - Without external motives
        - Trying to accomplish one specific task without thinking too far ahead
        - E.g.: Artist → Best way to pull off these artistic goal is to put aside your external motives for those goals while you’re doing it.
            - A writer who is writing a novel that is constantly thinking about how much the book is going to sell and how good the feedback from the peers will be, etc.. - is going to poison the actual work that’s being done

> “They do not make a display of themselves and so are illustrious.
They do not affirm their own views and so are well known.
They do not brag about themselves and so are accorded merit.
They do not boast about themselves and so are heard of for a long time.
- *Daodejing 22*
> 
- By pursuing the actual things itself, rather than thinking about these external motivations - you actually have more success in the long run.
- For Kongzi:
    - Non-action requires cultural and moral training
        - Practice ritual propriety, need teacher pointing out flaws, need education…
- For Laozi:
    - Ritual propriety are very inauthentic - training through cultural and moral cultivation is going the wrong direction for Laozi.
    - E.g.: Stepping on someone else’s foot & holding the door open for someone
        - Cultural and moral training is inauthentic
    - It is also ***ineffective***
        - … and may result in the ***opposite*** of what you wanted.
        - Because of the way the *Dao* operates in ways that are opposite to many of our human instinct and which are very much opposite to the kinds of ideas that Confucian ethicists and Maoists tried to put forward.
            - The most authentic way of being is to be able to simply forget those kinds of moral training and cultural ideas and simply get to a state where you are simply being who you are.
    - The danger of ***ego*** and ***ulterior motives***
        - These attributes poison any form of actions you take
    - You still have “goals,” but can only achieve these by letting go of those goals
        - Ironic because it’s counterintuitive but the only way to achieve these goals is to let go of them.
            - E.g.: The writer example that’s so caught up with the end result..
    - Give up your personal attachments
        - This entails being able to achieve a goal, but being able to do it in a way that you’re not caught up in feeling like the end results of the goal somehow belongs to you.
    - Treat them as straw dogs
        - Any people you are trying to help, any goal you are trying to achieve… you treat them as straw dogs.
    
    > “Heaven and earth are not benevolent;
    They treat the myriads creatures as straw dogs.
    Sages are not benevolent;
    They treat the people as straw dogs.
    - *Daodejing 5*
    > 
    - These straw figures you make as part of a big ceremony - you put them up and prop them up as very important, but when the ceremony is over, you toss them aside as they were nothing.
- These might sound harsh and heartless, but *Daodejing* is purposely written counterintuitively, it’s trying to point towards a larger truth.
    - Truth of the straw dog passage is that the sage actually helps the people by not letting his ego get caught up in his end result.
        - He simply helps the people and then moves on.
    
    > “In the pursuit of learning, one does more each day;
    In the pursuit of the Way, one does less each day;
    One does less and less until one does nothing;
    One does nothing yet nothing is left undone.
    Gaining the world always is accomplished by following no activity.
    As soon as one actively tries, one will fall short of gaining the world.
    - *Daodejing 48*
    > 
    - Trying to get way from this instinct that to accomplish things, you always want to be doing more.
        - So it’s this gradual process of being able to get rid of those personal attachments, getting rid of your personal ego, setting aside those goals and unselfconsciously achieving things without even seeming to try.
- Timeliness (*shi*)
- Role Ethics
- Relational Virtuosity

## The Evolution of Virtue *(Du*)

- Originally: a power held only by Zhou royalty
- Kongzi: A kind of moral charisma
    - Kongzi democratizes this concept and says that anyone with a moral self-cultivation can have this kind of charismatic power.
    - Like the “pole star” - the spot in the night sky that does nothing and all the other stars rotates around it.
- Laozi:
    - The valley
        - It’s quite opposite to the pole star which is way up high, something everyone gazes up at and then it rotates around out of awe and admiration.
        - The valley is low down.
    - Water
        - Something low down that kind of naturally seeks the lowest point in the world, rather than seeking to be up high.
    - The opposite imagery is likely very deliberate.
        - We don’t necessarily have to agree with this critique of Confucianism, but you can see how it might be read that way.
            - Pole star is kind of standing up high, making a scene of itself & everyone notices it and can’t help but follow the example.
            - Metaphor for water and the valley for Laozi is very much the opposite. It’s something that simply sits there and you don’t even notice it nor think about it. Yet without effort and without ego and without being noticed, water just nourishes everything around it.
            - And result for Laozi of water simply being not lording over anything, putting itself below everyone, and everything is something really good.
                - You will have lush valley full of life and it’s not like water every now and then stands up and demands for recognition, it just does it without thinking.

## Emptiness & Spontaneity

- Emptiness = similar to many of the terms already encountered in the *Daodejing*
- We’ve been looking at the concept of *nonaction* largely in terms of ethics and in terms of politics.
- Talking about *Virtue* = that metaphor of the Valley, a lot of that seems to be pointing towards questions of ethics. how to help people, how to be a good person.
    - Emptiness & Spontaneity are both connected to those discussions, but they can also apply to many other contexts.
- Example of something that’s easier to accomplish when you are actively trying not to do it.
    - E.g.: Sleeping - if you have insomnia or if you are struggling to fall asleep, the worst thing you can do is *try to fall asleep.* Trying to fall asleep generally doesn’t work because then you’re thinking about it and you’re not letting your body just kind of unselfconsciously do what it naturally does.
        - Because you’re probably going to get stressed out by thinking about larger goals.
        - Experts has said that better strategy to fall asleep is *trying to stay awake.* And presumably the reason that works is because you’re focusing your mind away from your desire to fall asleep - which allows your body to simply do what it needs to do without thinking about it.
        - ***Emptying your head of any larger goals.***
- An approach to the world that is:
    - Open to spontaneity
        - You aren’t assuming what’s going to happen next and you’re in a state where you’re able to respond to any unexpected situation that might come up.
    - “*Empty”*
        - Your empty of any preconceived notion of what’s happening next and you simply respond to whatever does happen.
        - E.g.: Sports - Master tennis player, to achieve that mastery, the person needs to practice hour after hour & they would need to study the basic techniques, would have to learn the basic moves and counter moves, etc… And all of that requires some kind of *deliberate* training and mastery.
            - But eventually you would want to get to a state where those sets of skills are so ingrained inside you that you don’t have to think before you act.
            - In that state of openness, emptiness and spontaneity is also a feature of *non-action.*
            - So if they are playing a game against a really good player, that person hits the ball in a certain way, he’s not going to win if he sees the ball coming and spends some time thinking about the best solution, he needs to simply respond to the play in the right way without thinking.
                - Constantly open to every possible action that can come up.

> “Thirty spokes are joined in the hub of a wheel.
But only by reling on what is not there, do we have the use of the carriage.
By adding and removing clay we form a vessel.
But only by reling on what is not there, dowe have use of the vessel…
And so, what is there is the basis for profit
What is not there is the basis for use.
- *Daodejing 11*
> 
- Wheels has those spokes, but it’s emptiness within the wheel that really allow it to work.
- If you create a vessel, you’re using the external material of the clay to create the emptiness inside. And it’s the emptiness that gives it its use. If you fill it up with something, you have profit, but if you keep it empty, you potentially have infinite use for it.

## Empty Mind

- Example of famous story from a form of Buddhism heavily influenced by *Daoism*
    - This very important person goes to visit a *Zen* or *Chan monk* (very important monk), and wants to learn about Buddhism and about life. So he sits down and this monk starts pouring him a cup of tea. But he keeps pouring and pouring until the cup is full. He doesn’t stop pouring and the cup overflows until finally this very self-important man says to “stop.” But the monk replies that this is basically a metaphor for why he can’t teach anything to this important man. Because ***he’s arrived with a full mind***. And the only way to learn anything new is you must first empty your mind.
        - In other words, he’s come already confident he knows the answers, he’s come already viewing himself as an expert and it means he’s not going to be receptive to new ideas or be able to respond to the world in an open way.
            - The idea is not explicitly laid out in the *Daodejing*, but I think we could make a case that this is a notion built into these concepts of spontaneity. And it can be found in many of the metaphors in the *Daodejing.* (Like those about water)

## The Spontaneous

- *Ziran* 自然
    - What is so of itself
    - Note of caution, it doesn’t necessarily mean “Nature” or “Natural” - similar idea but a little different
    - In classical Chinese, it really does mean something that’s ***simply is*** something that is being and acting just the way that it would without any self-conscious action and without any deliberate effort.
- The ultimate form taken by *non-action.*
    - Once you achieved *true* *non-action,* it’s almost as if things happen on their own and you’re not even trying.
- Accomplishing things with no sense of ego.
    - Someone who has achieved *true* *non-action* is able to accomplish things with no real sense of ego.

> “The greatest of rules is but a shadowy presence;
Next is the ruler who is loved and praised;
Next is the one who is feared;
Next is the one who is reviled…

…[the greatest rulers] are cautious and honour words.
When their task is done and the work complete,
Their people all say, “This is just how we are [*wo ziran* 我自然]
-*Daodejing 11*
> 
- The best rules are those where people are almost unaware of their existence
    - People don’t even realize that the rule has had any hand in cultivating and creating the kind of environment where people have the things they need and go about their lives very naturally.

## The *Daodejing* and Politics

- Is the *Daodejing* a Primitivist text?
    - Political views of *Daodejing text* are somewhat ambiguous - But then there are few chapters here and there that have a strong primitivist elements.
        - It’s trying to push for a somewhat non-interventionist approach to politics that isn’t forceful, but then there are few chapters here and there that have a strong primitivist elements.
    - E.g.: Chapter 80 (Most primitive - lays out a Eutopia perspective where people are so robbed of curiosity and desire that they are just content to live a simple life with basic agricultural villages without development of technology), Chapter 37 (The government and ruler tries to ensure that nobody dares to have ideas or curiosity that might cause chaos in a society).
