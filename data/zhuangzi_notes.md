# Zhunagzi

- What is Zhungzi responding to and making use of?
    - Pretty much everyone and everything we’ve looekd so far
        - He responds (critically) to Confucian and Mohist ethics
        - Clearly heavily influenced by Laozi
        - He incorporates concepts from the Physiological Turn
        - He is clearly trained in new systems of logic from the Linguistic Turn (School of Logic)
        - He is heavily influenced by ideas of Individualism (Yang Zhu)

## Zhungzi and Laozi

- Where are Zhunagzi and Laozi similar? Where are they different?
    - Shared focus on Nature and Dao
        - Human exists in and part of a nature, forgetting this fact leads to a harm
            - Heaven for universe = Zhungzi / Dao for universe = Laozi
        - The dangers of desire?
            - Zhungzi is more forgiving for human nature (perhaps due to Individualism), but is still skeptical
        - Biggest difference: Politics vs. Individualism
            - Laozi: Take ego out of politics, don’t seek power - interested in subtle, non-cohersive, non-interventionist approach to the world (More about the society, less about individuals)
            - Zhungzi: Politics is not slight of an interest to him
        - Nonaction and counterintuitive logic
            - Play with the assumption around the world
- “Therapeutic” philosophy?
    - Not only trying to make a philosophical point
        - Not laying out a full system aka “here’s how you should exactly approach the world and life”
    - The reader should not simply be **convinced,** but should be **changed** by the experience.
        - Less about convincing, more about providing ways to change the perspective of a person
    - May not provide direct answers

## Zhungzi: The Text

- Received text divided into 3 sections:
1. Inner Chapters: 1-7 (*Neipian*)
    - Most likely written by Zhungzi himself - the most authentic representation of him
2. Outer Chapters: 8-22 (*Wapian*)
    - Most likely written by students, people who were influenced by him and maybe some is from Zhungzi himself - school of Zhungzi
3. Miscellaneous Chapters: 22-33 (*Zapian*)
    - Not sure where it’s from, some ideas seems like him, but some aren’t
- Received version attributed to Guo Xiang (d. 312 CE) - lived centuries after Zhungzi but had extremely strong influenced on editing the Zhungzi’s text to what we have today.
    - Guo Xiang revised and edited the text
    - Wrote a very influential commentary
- Inner Chapters:
    - Largely written by one person
    - Maybe from the south (Chu)??

## Zhungzi’s Importance

- Creative writing style
- Considered one of the founders of “Daoism”
- Ideas helped shape Zen (Chan) Buddhism

# Philosophical Concept: Big Question

## The Bird named “Breeze”

> “Horse shaped clouds, more of dust, living things blowing breath at each other - is the blue-green of Heaven its proper color or just its being so endlessly far away? It looks just the same to her gazing down from above.”
> 
- We look up at the sky we see a blue color, but is that actually its color?
- Now we look at a giant bird looking down at the sky, it must look the same for the bird as well

## Perspective

- Uses concept of perspective to kind of confuse and skew reader’s mind and vision (as in for ideas)
- ***Spiritual Vertigo***: It can be overwhelming just how tiny the earth is. You can feel insignificant sometimes - especially when you just lay down and look up at the sky
    - E.g.: Hubble telescope - they picked one single spot in the sky where there was nothing aka an empty space. W/ the hubble telescope the empty space actually had millions of galaxy inside... Giving a mind boggling idea of how big and vast the universe is, it’s incomprehensible!

> The accusing quail laughs and her saying “Where is she going? I rear up and don’t go more than a few yards before coming down, soaring and roaming amid brambles and briars - this indeed is the perfection of flying! Where is she going?” This is the debate between little and big.
> 
- Giant bird in the sky vs little quails that just go from one bush to next.
    - From quail’s perspective it’s silly - they think their way of living (in the bushes) is the way so what is this Giant bird doing?
- What is Zhungzi’s opinion on the quails? are they inferior to the Bird named Breeze? Or simply different?
    - The little quails are kind of metaphor for previous philosophers like Confucians, Mohists, etc… Although they might have good philosophical ideas and solutions, they hey are just narrow minded…
    - The quails are critical of the big knowledge as it seems too abstract and vague.
- A large bird needs a huge amount of wind to fly
- A large boat needs a large amount of water to float
    - Whereas a tiny motor boat can float in a tiny body of water
- ***Big ideas need a big framework (or perspective) to work***

> “People going to the green meadows can bring three meals and return with their bellies full. People going a hundred li need to grind grain for an overnight. People going a thousand li need to gather grain for three months”
> 
- Studying Zhuangzi’s philosophy is like a big trip
    - We will need to prepare for it
    - By the end, it will have changed us
    - To think in “big knowledge” terms, we need a larger perspective
- Or an alternative reading:
    - All scales of size and duration are entirely relative
    - ***It is impossible to fully imagine anything outside of our limited experience***
    - ***The best we can do is to reorient ourselves around knowledge of this fact***
        - Become ***aware*** of our own limitations to knowledge and the view.

## Therapeutic Philosophy

- “Big Knowledge” seems to suggest an ability to be open to a variety of possible perspectives
- Getting away from narrow thinking and definitions
- For example, “right” and “wrong” make little sense as categories, without context
    - Even these fundamental distinction in the world don’t make a lot of sense as categories - one thing can be correct, but it can be incorrect in another situation
    - Don’t get stuck to thinking black and white!

> … “I heard what Jie Yu said. It was big but didn’t stand for anything. It went on and on without coming back. I was frightened by what he said. I was as endless as the Milky Way, full of inconsistencies, and didn’t approach the human situation (*ren qing*)”
> 
- It’s mostly about how people being too narrow minded to appreciate big understanding / knowledge
    - It just doesn’t tell me what it means to be a human in the world despite this giant journey and big knowledge… You missed the point!

> “A man from Song invested in ceremonial caps and took them to Yue. But the Yue people cut their hair and tattoo their bodies and had no use for them. Yao brought order to the people of the empire and stabilized the government within the seas. But when he went to see the four masters of the distant Maiden Mountains, north of the Fen River, he lost the world in a daze.” Zhuangzi 1: *Wandering Round and About*
> 
- Your perspective on the world changes once you adopt these big knowledge approach to life
- One seems great in one situation, but other can be COMPLETELY useless

## Perspective (2)

- The big gourd
    - “Use” is entirely relative
    - There is no stable value to anything - it is ***entirely contextual***
- It’s a shame - the problem is you thought gourd had one use. Try to think from another perspective! E.g.: cut the gourd in half and use it as a paddle to go along the vast water!
    - There is no one use to a gourd

> “There were some people in Song who were good at making ointment to prevent chapped hands…” *Zhuangzi 1: Wandering Round and About*
> 
- They sell the recipe of the ointment and the guy uses the recipe to be one of the wealthiest person in the country
- The ointment doesn’t change (people who used it to earn wages) - the difference is the open-mindedness of how you use it
- The gnarled tree
    - The use of the useless
        - This tree doesn’t have use in your mind, it’s uselessness is good. Because it’s useless no body will chop it down and it will be alive for as long as it can be

> “Why not plant it by a nothing-at-all village in a wide empty waste? You could do nothing, dilly-dallying by its side, or nap, ho-hum, beneath it. It won’t fall to any axe’s chop and nothing will harm it. Since it isn’t any use, what bad can happen to it?
> 
- Making an additional point of usefulness of uselessness - use of things is how we perceive how much material we can get from the resource... BUT just existing is a use (aka lying beside a tree and napping is a good use of time!)

## Conclusion

- Influenced by Yang Zhu, he de-emphasizes the importance of social conventions in our understanding of the self
    - These conventions have no absolute, consistent meaning
- Reading his text as therapeutic philosophy, he does not necessarily offer a clear plan of action
- “Big Knowledge” presents an approach to life
    - It does not offer an obvious, narrow use
    - Instead, it makes one flexible to multiple perspectives
    - From this large perspective, is there not “use” in simply being in the world?

# On Equalizing Things (*Qi wu lun)*

## Zhungzi

- Trained as a logician?
    - All those ideas about about logic, the white horse not being a horse example…
    - Though he is very critical of logicians - he thinks that logic and language will only get so far
    - Friend with Huizi

## Big Knowledge and Little Knowledge

- Remember Huizi’s paradoxes:
    - “Heaven is as low as earth, the mountains are level with the marshes.”
        - One of the things that he’s trying to get across is the relativity of these claims…
            - The heaven is as low as earth - mountains are level with marshes at it’s base…
    - Trying to see and understand the whole picture
        - Zhungzi is starting at a similar point - he is skeptical about the use of logics as being able to get you fully to the truth

## Zhungzi and Heaven

- The meaning of “Heaven” continues to change during the Warring States era
- Mozi = God, Kongzi = Kind of ambiguous but more human like, Laozi = Puts it together with earth
- When he says “Heaven,” does Zhungzi mean “Nature”?

## Pipes and Haven

> “You’ve heard the pipes of people, but not the pipes of earth. Or if you’ve heard the pipes of earth, you haven’t heard the pipes of Heaven.” *Zhuangzi 2: On Equalizing Things page 214*
> 
- What is happening here?
    - Piping (very literal meaning) = Playing an instrument
        - You blow air into it, and the air flowing through it creates musical sounds. You adjust the fingers on the hole, you’re simply changing the way the air passes through the pipe
- **Pipes of People:** Flutes, deliberately being played
    - Literally means = human being deliberately playing a pipe / flute
    - People playing songs deliberately using the pipe
- **Pipes of Earth:** The wind blowing along the shapes of the earth
    - Wind blows along the different shapes of the earth, creating different types of sound and noise
- Difference is scale and ***agency*** - we know who is playing the flute, but we don’t know who’s playing the pipes of earth (where is the wind coming from? What causes it to move in that way?) - only thing we at least know is the effect of what’s happening.
- **Pipes of Heaven:** Raising questions about the universe
    - Wind blows against different shapes of earth, where does the wind even come from? where does the planet even come from?
    - Ultimately, the further away you get from the easily understood process of human being deliberately doing something, and more you enter the realm of unanswerable mysteries, the less certain you become.

## Perspective

- He goes from ground (world of humans) → sky (world of nature) → universe (world of cosmos)
- But then he comes back to the human body from the bigger and bigger questions

> “The hundred bones, the nine orifices’, the six organs all exist together. Which do I think of as closer to me? *Page 216*
> 
- If there is no true lord among them, whether I find it’s essence or not makes no difference to the truth
- Think about the way things are connected to each other

## Agency

- ***Agency***: Something that is done by someone or something
- Who is “in charge” of the unfolding of the universe?
    - Who is playing the pipes of heaven?
        - Is there some greater being that is causing this or does the universe simply operates on its own
- For the matter, who or what is “in charge” of the body?
    - Tissue, organs, bones, etc…? Is a person just combination of different body parts and cells?

## Big Knowledge

- What is innovative about this idea?
    - A new view on the role of philosophy
        - It’s the ability to see that everything is connected to everything else and all of these things together make up one unitary hole.
    - Trying to consider the whole picture
        - for him it’s not about dividing things up and trying to understand them individually, but trying to understand the whole picture
    - By itself it might appear “useless…” but can change your approach to life
        - This BIG picture of understanding or trying to see how even my own body is just all of the different organs working together, and my body is part of earth and earth is part of the greater cosmos… What do you do with that knowledge?… It can potentially change your perspective and approach to your life.

# The Pivot of the Way (*dao shu*)

## The Linguistic Turn

- He is skeptical about how useful language and logic can be in terms of understanding the world as it actually is
    - His skepticism might be an influence from *Daodejing*

> “Saying is not just blowing. Saying says something. But if what it says is not fixed, then does it really say anything? Or does it say nothing? *Page 217*
> 
- Blowing = Puffs of air. Birds make sounds, but it’s not same as human languages
    - Zhungzi is actually right, vast amount of spoken language is just puffs of air - same way as the pipe making sounds.
- The point is: Language is just blowing - puffs of air, but it’s not just puffs of air because when you are using language, you are actually saying something.
- Language allows us to ***communicate***
    - The meaning of our words aren’t always fixed - there could be disputes over the meaning of terms.
        - And the words that we use don’t always corresponds to the object that we’re attempting to describe.
    - But creates false distinctions.
        - The danger of language in part is that it creates false distinctions - if we allow ourselves to get too caught up to these false distinctions, there’s the danger that our whole lives can go in the wrong direction.
            - Because we become convinced that these false distinctions are true and that we take them very seriously and we could sometimes kill each other over these things
        - Skepticisms about certainty, the way we use philosophy to try to create better understanding of the world which ultimately leads us to lesser understanding of the world.

> “There is a beginning. There is a not-yet beginning to be a beginning. There is not yet beginning to be a not-yet beginning to be a beginning… *Page 219*
> 
- He’s making fun of logicians, and all the things that we can do with language, but he is specifically trying to point out what philosophy and language often try to do is to create clear distinctions between things.
    - You have the moment something begins but what comes before that? We have the not yet beginning to be a beginning, what comes before that..? You can just go on forever
- Philosophers takes things apart and removes all the pieces, they divide things up as much as possible and they think they’ve gotten somewhere (which in-perhaps they have!?), but if you don’t have a full comprehension of what each of those pieces do, then did we get anywhere really?
    - E.g.: Best way to find out how a car operates is taking it apart and see how all the pieces work together, BUT Zhungzi would ass that if you don’t understand how the pieces work together and you don’t understand the totality of the car, you don’t have a car anymore…

> “This is the doctrine of the parallel birth of “this” and “that.” Even so, born together they die together - *Page 217*
> 
- The moment you tried to use the language to divide the world aka usage of “*this*” and *“that,”* you’ve actually just created a false distinction.
    - The moment you point out “*this*” there has to be a “*that*” which is the counterpoint to *“this.”* The moment you stop dividing things, *“this”* and *“that”* both disappear

## “*Right*” and “*Wrong*”

- We use language and philosophy to try and divide the world up and understand it, but if we don’t understand how those divisions are actually not real and everything that we are dividing up still exists as part of a complete whole, you can get yourself in trouble.
- ***Normative Value:*** The concept of saying one thing is right and one thing is wrong
- One problem with the Confucians and the Mohists:
    - Their worldview is too narrow
        - the little quails
        - the morning mushroom
        - He is making fun of Confucians and Mohists due to them living in their own little world

> “With everything they meet they become entangled. Day after day they use their minds in strife…” 

”They bound off like an arrow or a crossbow pellet, certain that they are the arbiters of right and wrong. They cling to their positions as though they had sworn before the gods, sure that they are holding on to victory. They fade like fall and winter - such is the way they dwindle day by day. They drown in what they do. You cannot make them turn back”
(From Burton Watson’s translation)
> 
- For him, this failure to see the much bigger perspective of the world where you try to take in account the totality of everything gets you in trouble because you have this very narrow perspective. You divide the world into right and wrong, (Confucians = this is right, that is wrong… Mohists = this is wrong, that is right) they end up fighting over it, they exhaust themselves and their whole life is wasted

## The Pivot of the Way

> “So is there really a this and that? Or isn’t there any this or that? The place where neither this nor that finds its counterpart is called ***the pivot of the Way.*** Once the pivot finds its socket it can respond endlessly. What’s right is endless. And what’s wrong is endless too. This is why I say it’s better to throw them open to the light.” *Zhuangzi 2: On Equalizing Things p.215*
> 
- For him, big understanding (knowledge) is about having much broader perspective and seeing things in much larger context and being able to operate in such way that you understand the relativity of things.
    - From this much larger perspective, the world isn’t as simple as one sometimes tend to think, (This one thing is always right and this other thing is always wrong) but with the slight shift in perspective, you can actually make use of these things.
    - You’re able to see the totality, see how things shift, you are able to respond to the world without already having in your mind this incorrect sense of everything being right or wrong or this or that.
- A way of being
    - Understanding the larger unity of all things
    - Not being fooled by language or certainty
    - A state of “emptiness” (compare to Laozi)
    - Open to dynamic nature of right and wrong
        - You understand that things change, that things are complicated, that things are part of a larger whole - so you’re responsive, your spontaneous, you have an empty mind when it comes to what you think how the world should look like. Zhungzi think this is possible and is great to an individual.

# Zhuangzi on Life (Monday Lecture)

## Zhunagzi so far…

- Big Knowledge
    - All about ***Perspective:*** Trying to understand how narrow your own perspective is - and how different the world looks when zoomed out
- The pipes of Heaven
    - Not only about perspective, but that ultimately everything in the world is this one big ***totality.*** And we all exists within that totality as one part of it.
    - Human mind tries to divide it up and explain who’s making these things happen - we look for causality
    - But Zhunagzi suggests that in the end everything just causes itself.
- The pivot of the Way
    - The distinctions we make about the world exist in our minds
        - Taking this relativity and uncertainty and then acting in the world in a particular way that’s based on the knowledge of this uncertainty and relativism

### Perspective

- Think of the big picture
    - Not just look at the narrow part of the world and assume that’s everything
- Think about how things are connected
    - Not only think about big picture view, but also understanding how everything is influencing and influenced by everything else

### Uncertainty

- We are all limited by our narrow perspectives
    - It’s kind of a wisdom / acknowledgement of the limitations of your experiences and capacity to know things
    - World is always going to be bigger than what you can see
- We can never be in possession of the full picture
    - It’s just not an option - we’re never gonna know everything

> A frog in a well cannot conceive of the ocean - *Zhuangzi*
> 
- Frog’s whole world is that water in the well
    - If a turtle come up to the well and tell the frog about the ocean, it doesn’t even have the capacity to understand what an ocean is
- To a certain extent, we are the frog in the well and we can’t avoid being it
    - Though, he does suggest that at least you can be aware of your limited knowledge
- Language and logic are unreliable
    - Tools that we think are powerful and accurate ultimately can only take us so far
        - He does acknowledge that they are useful tools though - we can communicate things to other people and some things are understood.
    - But their meanings are neither absolute nor eternal
        - You can say something and the person can kind of understand what you mean, but that doesn’t mean the words are perfectly and accurately describing the world
- It seems like Zhungzi is trying to take away all of our feelings of certainty
    - Mohists and Confucianist tries to assign moral or normative values to things (right and wrong), but it’s also a product of perspective in context and non-absolute/non-permanent values (Kind of applies to everything…)

## Zhungzi on Life (1)

- Is Zhuangzi skeptic?
    - Someone who denies the possibility of (the certainty of) knowledge
        - Is it impossible to know about anything?
        - Problematic suggestion because pure skeptic is kind of a self-defeating proposition - as in the end if you can’t know anything there is no point in writing a book of philosophy
    
    > “One night, Zhungzi dreamed of being a butterfly - a happy butterfly, showing off and doing as he pleased, unaware of being Zhuangzi. Suddenly he awoke, drowsily, Zhuangzi again. And he could not tell whether it was Zhungzi who had dreamt the butterfly or the butterfly who was dreaming Zhuangzi. But there must be some difference between them! This is called “the transformation of things” -*Zhuangzi Chapter 2*
    > 
    - One way of interpretation: Simply a description of experience - Zhuangzi fell asleep and in the dream he was convinced that he was a butterfly totally unaware that he had ever been a human. And he woke up confused with some kind of uncertainty. (Am I Zhuangzi who just dreamt as a butterfly or am I butterfly who is dreaming about being Zhuangzi)
        - It might suggest a ***general uncertainty** -* what ever senses we experience and the world we find ourselves in is the kind of world we are in, but we always need to have this level of uncertainty if it’s real or if we are just perceiving the world as it really is.
    - Another way of interpretation: Commentary on death - He has this moment where he has no idea what happens after you die. He thinks that maybe there is this kind of afterlife where this butterfly could be this metaphorical symbol of and maybe you have no idea in that next life that you ever lived a previous one.
        - It at least hints toward some kind of uncertainty - it’s so uncertain how one interprets it

> Zhuangzi and Huizi were wandering on a bridge over the Hao River. Zhuangzi said, “Look at those mottled fish out wandering at ease. That’s what fish like!” -*Zhunagzi Chapter 17*
> 
- Huizi asks how do you know what fish is like? You’re not a fish?
    - Zhungzi says how do you know that I don’t know what fish is like?
        - Huizi turns that around and says I’m not you so I don’t know what you are like, but I do know that you’re not a fish and therefore you don’t know what is like.

> Huizi said, “You’re not a fish. How do you know what fish is like?” … Zhuangzi said, “Let’s go back to the beginning. When you asked how I knew what fish liked, you had to know I already knew in order to ask. I know it by the Hao River - that’s how [/where].” - *Zhuangzi Chapter 17*
> 
- He doesn’t address the Huizi’s logical propositions and he kind of plays on two things:
1. Usage of language to get back at Huizi
    - You asked how do I know what fish is like, you can’t ask that question unless you acknowledge that I do know what fish is like
2. What is meant to be a pun
    - I know it by the Hao River - that’s HOW (Hao). The word that’s being used as “*how*” can be used as the word “*where*”
    - He may be playing with the language here and is saying if you ask me how / where I know, I know it right *here* standing at this river
- He seems to be suggesting by turning it around by trying not play into Huizi’s logic and trying to take it back to the basics

## Discussion: Zhuangzi and Huizi

- Who makes the stronger argument here, Huizi or Zhuangzi?
- Why do you think this is the stronger argument?
- What is each thinker claiming about the nature of knowledge?
- More briefly: can Zhuangzi know what fish like?

## Zhuangzi on Life (2)

- Is Zhuangzi a relativist?
    - Does Zhuangzi think it’s impossible to say anything else right or wrong? Does he think there is no right? or wrong
    - Someone who believes truth and morality are not absolute
        - A true relativist is someone who doesn’t think right or wrong mean anything at all
            - Again why would Zhuangzi write a book of philosophy if he was a true relativist?

## Zhuangzi and Relativism

### At the very least, we should not attach ourselves to firm (static / unchanging) moral truths

- Not necessarily because there is no difference between right or wrong, but becasue the way we try to capture right / the way we try to catch it in a permanent eternal consistent way doesn’t work
    - The moment you change the perception or when context shifts, right and wrong might suddenly look very different
- We need to be aware that the ability to know things is too limited to ever have really strong definitive opinion on things
- The moment we make claim of the world, we have lost the sight of the full picture
    - We artificailly divide the world up the moment when we make a claim
- “Right and “wrong have shifting and uncertain meanings

### Big Knowledge

- Taking on broader perspective
- Admitting the limitations of your knowledge
    - Offers a starting point to his solution to uncertainties

### Standing at the Pivot of the Way (1)

- You declare something beautiful, by doing so you are also saying it’s opposite is ugly. Which is an artificial distinction in the world because in reality beauty and ugly doesn’t have consistent meanings
    - Conventional beauty standards in the world are social conventions and individual taste varies. When you exit the human world, those perceptions are completely different. So “beauty” even as a kind of constructed social convention is impermanent and meaningless

> Nothing in the world is bigger than the tip of an autumn hair, but Mount Tai is small. No one lives longer than a dead child and Peng Zu died young. Heaven and earth were born alongside me, and the ten thousand things and I are one - *Zhuangzi* Chapter 2
> 
- In a sense, when you shift your perspective - all these things are true even though they sound counterintuitive
    - “No one lives longer than a dead child” = every second we exist we change, we exist only in the moment
        - “Us” in the present doesn’t continue on to the next moment
        - Dead child and any other person really do live just as long as each other
- In reality, everything is part of a great total unity

> “If we’re already one, can I say it? But since I’ve said we’re one, can I not say it? The unity and my saying it make two. The two and their unity make three. Starting from here, even a clever mathematician couldn’t get it, much less an ordinary person!” - *Zhuangzi Chapter 2*
> 
- We’re all part of this totality and all the distinction we try to make are artificial and don’t really mean anything
    - But that’s not how we perceive the world…
    - “Unity and my saying it makes two” = I’m commenting on the unity of the world and by commenting on that (& acknowledging that everything is one whole total unity), then actually I’m not existing as part of that unity because I’m commenting on it.
        - I’ve created two things: unity and me standing here and saying everything is united. Which means that there is now this awareness that I and the Unity is two things which makes THREE things: awareness, I and Unity…
        - TLDR: *The more we analyze the world, the more we divide it up* (it keeps going on forever)
- There are no “things” that exist independently of everything else
    - We constantly view things as independent on our own minds, but really there is nothing in the world that is completely independent of other things

> “Penumbra said to Shadow, “First you walk and then you stop. First you sit and then you rise. Why are you so restless?” Shadow said, “Do I depend on something to be the way I am? Does what I depend on also depend on something to be the way it is? -*Zhuangzi Chapter 2*
> 
- He is trying to show an endless chain of interconnected causality.
    - Imagine you’re looking at a shadow, shadow exists as it’s own thing (section of space where there is less light hitting it because there is an object standing there to block the light) - what causes the shadow to move?
        - Shadow is not moving, the person is moving. And person moving is causing the shadow to move, but what’s making the person move or what’s moving the light?
        - All sorts of ways leads to causality of the person’s movement as you zoom out
- No matter what you look at (the things its doing and the shape and forms it has), is always the result of other influences. *Everything in the world is influenced by something else - everything is interconnected.*

### Standing at the Pivot of the Way (2)

- Seeing and understanding the fundamental unity of all things
- Occupying a position that does not assign fixed truth
    - Idea of living for him is to reside in a mental space that allows of shifting of interconnected things
    - To be aware that your values are temporary snapshot of the reality in front of you
- Spontaneously responding to things as they are
    - Instead of trying to force things to become the way you want them to be and taking the “absolute” truth and going out to make them happen - *you go through life a little bit unsure and try to take things* *as they are* and purely just respond to those things

> “To know what Haven does and to know what humans do is to have reached perfection. Those who know what Heaven does are born of Heaven. Those who know what humans do use what they know they know to nurture what they know they don’t know, living out their Heavenly years not dying along the way. This is the flourishing of knowledge. - *Zhuangzi,* The Greatest Ancestral Teacher
> 
- There is a distinction between nature - things that are out of control vs what humans have within their control
    - Use what you know and nurture what you know and to certain extent - *just do your best*

## Zhuangzi and Life

- What Haven does
- What man does/people do
- The “True Person” (*zhenren*)
    - Zhunagi’s ideal state of being
    - Possibly partially ironic/humorous
    - Would become a prevalent theme in later Daoism

### What does it mean to be “True Person” - Great Ancestral Teacher

- Finding calm and equanimity
    - Unfavourable traits are things alongside - anxiousness and aggressiveness

> “The true people of the olden days knew nothing of loving life and nothing of hating death. They emerged without delight and returned without resistance. They came and went briskly, nothing more. *They neither forgot their beginning nor sought their end. They enjoyed what they received, forgot it, and handed it back.* This is called not using the mind to block the Way, not using the human to help Heave. These are called true people
> 
- Some people might counter-argue Zhuangzi by saying that he is saying people shouldn’t have emotions, but that’s not the case. He emphasize that we should have *balanced feelings* - we should be open to taking things as they come and not getting too caught up by it and just simply handing it back.

> “Hence what they liked was one and what they didn’t like was one. Their being one was one and their not being one was one. Seeing it as one. they were followers of Heaven. Seeing it as not one, they were followers of humanity. When neither Heaven nor humanity wins out over the other, this is called being a true person…”
> 
- Difficult proposition of being a human - you need to acknowledge the unity of things and accept the world as it is. If you are going to exist as a person in the world, you are kind of stuck with some of our human ways of thinking about things.
    - It’s all about the *balance* you have to find

> “The Big Lump burdens me with a form, labours me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death. So if I like my life, for the same reason I must also like my death”
> 
- Big Lump = Big hunk of something (aka world / existence)
    - We then plays with our expectations: birth / being alive is what you cherish and is something wonderful, aging is bad (bad vitality and health), death is the worst thing of all
    - He gives a reverse-tale of life here where we are burdened with being born, life is a lot of work & stress, it lifts some of the burden off of you as you age and finally you get to rest with death.
    - If I like my life, for the same reason I must also like my death

> “You hide your boat in the ravine and your fish net in the swamp and tell yourself that they will be safe. But in the middle of the night, a strong man shoulders them and carries them off and in your stupidity, you don’t know why it happened. You think you do right to hide little things in big ones and yet they get away from you. But if you were to hide the world in the world, so that nothing could get away, this would be the final reality of the constancy of things.”
> 
- Hide the world in the world = concept of life and death
    - Imagine that this is a metaphor for how we cherish certain things (the boat and the net) when we think about life we cherish *certain part about* life (youth / birth) and we try to *protect them*.
    - At the end of the day we *cherish our life*, but going back to the concept of life and death, they both *co-exist.*
    - We tend to pick the “life” part and hate the opposite: “death”, but Zhuangzi is saying that this is an approach to life that guarantees constant stress, anxious and afraid. You are trying to avoid things that are inevitable part of the whole scope of existence - *there is always beginning and an end* and that’s inevitable
- If you accept being alive means dying, that’s hiding the world in the world - *you’re accepting the whole picture* & you’re understanding that life & death are just artificial division you made up in your mind.
- The problem begin the moment you try to hide the little things and protect them - you need to let go of that and all of the negative things are just part of life and accept it as a whole.

## Conclusions

- Although Zhuangzi offers few clear answers…
    - We can find connections between his “big knowledge” perspective and suggestions on how to live our lives
    - Therapeutic philosophy
        - It’s possible to approach life very differently when you have a different perspective of the world
    - Proceeding from a new perspective
